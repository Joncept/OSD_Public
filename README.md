One Stop Directory - Public Repository

***Help Wanted***

I have recently started with a local charity and we have no central signposting system, or even much of an idea of what's available around us.  Some valuable signposting oppertunities exist only in one team members head, if they are off sick or are busy our clients are missing out on available support.

My project is to create an open source website, that's as modular and portable as possible. So that other areas, charities or well anyone can create a similar website for their area.  Possibly down the line a mobile app could be developed using this existing backend so there's one single 'source of truth'.

My idea:

 - [ ] Wordpress site, it's not the best but it's stable and easy to use for people without training, should be simpler to add/edit data as required without requirement of hiring a web developer for every change.
	
 - [ ] Utilise custom fields for a 'directory' containing individual services with details (opening hours, address, contact details, map etc).
	
 - [ ] Allow filtering by category, name, location and if possible allow searching by postal code to show the closest services first.
	
 - [ ] Open source as much as possible and make as simple as possible for others to reproduce.  I like the idea of having two git repositories one private containing only data specific to this site and a public one containing everything else.
	
If anyone can provide help/support or input into this I would be very grateful and full credit will be given in the final product.  I have tried to place as much information as possible however I am happy to answer any questions that I can.
